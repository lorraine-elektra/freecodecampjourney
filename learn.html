                        An ambitious second-year Computer-Science student aspiring to be a proficient full stack
                        developer via self-study, certificate acquisition, internships and on the job training. I'm
                        eager to learn various aspects of software engineering including Front-end, Back-end, web
                        development frameworks, debugging, software writing and testing as well as any other beneficial
                        knowledge.Personally, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, reading, and listening to
                        music.In addition, I am a devout Christian who strives to improve my connection with Jesus.
                        Along with my loving father, my
                        mother is the person closest to my heart, and I would sacrifice anything for her, even if she
                        sometimes irritates me.

                    <div class="text">
                        During my six-month vacation after finishing my A-levels to enroll in a diploma program in
                        software engineering at IPMC, where we learned HTML, CSS, SQL, and other programming languages.
                        This increased my enthusiasm to switch to technology, and I quicklyÂ decided to change fields
                        from medicine to computer science. As a consequence, I applied to a Ghanaian institution using
                        my IGCSE results, and I was lucky to get accepted.
                        To begin with, I started my self-study adventure during my first year of university by talking
                        to other software engineers to learn about the job and then started my self-study path on
                        Coursera by earning a certification in HTML/CSS and WordPress.

                        Although Freecodecamp has been quite helpful, you are not always guided to the
                        specific code problem, which occasionally makes fixes a little stressful. In certain cases,
                        the hint provided has nothing to do with the mistake. Additionally, having an acknowledgment
                        of recognition upon finishing a course would be wonderful as a source of inspiration.
                        Furthermore, the website isn't compatible with smaller devices, such as phones, which makes it
                        difficult to study in any way while you're using your phone in your spare time. Also,
                        some of the steps' content is too brief to effectively increase students' comprehension of
                        the course.
